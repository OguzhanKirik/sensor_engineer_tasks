# Sensor Fusion Engineer Tasks

This repository showcases a series of hands-on projects developed during the Udacity Sensor Fusion Nanodegree. It encompasses the integration and processing of data from LiDAR, radar, and camera sensors, culminating in the application of Kalman Filters for object tracking.

## 🚗 Overview

The projects within this repository are designed to simulate real-world scenarios encountered in autonomous vehicle perception systems. Each module focuses on a specific sensor modality or fusion technique, providing a comprehensive understanding of multi-sensor integration.

## 📁 Project Structure

* **Camera**: Projects related to image processing, object detection, and lane detection using camera data.
* **Radar**: Exercises focusing on processing radar measurements, including range and velocity estimation.
* **LiDAR**: Tasks involving point cloud processing, obstacle detection, and distance measurement using LiDAR data.
* **UnscentedKalmanFilter**: Implementation of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for fusing data from multiple sensors to track dynamic objects.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Sensor Data Processing**: Techniques for handling and interpreting raw data from LiDAR, radar, and camera sensors.
* **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors to achieve more accurate and reliable information than could be obtained from a single sensor.
* **Kalman Filtering**: Application of Kalman Filters, including the Extended and Unscented variants, for estimating the state of moving objects in the presence of noise and uncertainty.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Programming Languages: C++, Python
* Libraries and Tools: OpenCV, PCL (Point Cloud Library), Eigen
* Platforms: Ubuntu, ROS (Robot Operating System)
